# BuyBusy2 

This project is a React application that demonstrates state management using **Redux Toolkit**.  
Key Redux Toolkit features implemented in this project include:

- **createSlice**: Used to define reducers and actions for different parts of the application state (such as authentication, products, and cart).
- **createAsyncThunk**: Used for handling asynchronous logic, such as fetching products from an API or updating the cart in a database.
- **extraReducers**: Used within slices to handle actions generated by `createAsyncThunk` and other external actions, enabling advanced state transitions based on async results.

## Features

- Product listing with filtering and search
- Cart management (add, remove, update quantity)
- Asynchronous data fetching and updates using thunks
- Organized Redux state using slices for modularity and maintainability

## Technologies Used

- React
- Redux Toolkit
- React Redux

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
2. Start the development server:

## Notes

- The Redux store is configured with `serializableCheck: false` to allow non-serializable data in actions or state when necessary.
- All async logic (such as fetching or updating data) is handled using `createAsyncThunk` and managed in slices with `extraReducers`.
